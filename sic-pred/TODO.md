- Start with single-step FC?
  - difference from day-before - check residuals;
- Climatology
  - Use EASE grid?
    - can get reprocessed data for more years
    - no missing data
  - plot to see why 2 or 3 years is better (June or Sept)
  - worth bothering? - persistence far better, so could use differencing of
      eg 7 days
- Auto-encoding + VAR(MA)
  - PCA auto-encoder
    - plot explained_variance_ratio_
    - evaluate and visualise
  - CNN auto-encoder
    - train
    - visualise

PCA
- 2018-2020?
- look again at 1-day diff?
- N=50 seems a decent fit - try to predict
